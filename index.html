                        At the start of college, I initially pursued a degree in Education with a focus on Mathematics. However, my passion for 
                        computer science soon emerged, prompting me to switch my major during my sophomore year. Alongside my major in computer science, I maintained a minor in Mathematics. 
                        This shift in academic focus proved to be highly rewarding, as I excelled in both my major and minor courses, consistently earning nearly perfect straight A's. 
                        By the time of my graduation in May 2022, I had achieved an impressive overall GPA of 3.7, with an outstanding 3.9 GPA specifically within my major.
                        As a testament to my academic achievements, I graduated cum laude, reflecting my dedication and commitment to my studies.

                        I have a passion for problem-solving and thrive on being presented with challenging issues. 
                        This is why I am drawn to computer science and software development. 
                        Additionally, I am enthusiastic about data analytics and data science, as both require strong critical thinking skills. 
                        These fields align with my love for continuous learning, as I have always been a naturally curious individual. 
                        The ever-evolving nature of the tech industry ensures that there are always new things to learn, fueling my endless curiosity.

                    In my journey through the tech world, I've developed a keen interest in both data science and software engineering.
                    On my Work Experience Page, you'll see that I've delved deep into data from both the development and analytical sides, giving me a well-rounded perspective on how to handle it effectively.
                    This mix of experiences has really sparked my curiosity in both areas.
                    I'm on the lookout for a company that'll let me keep growing, take on challenging projects, and come up with creative solutions.
                    I thrive in environments that value learning and offer chances to sharpen my skills.
                    Ultimately, I aspire to make a meaningful impact at a company by leveraging my skills and contributing to its success and growth.
