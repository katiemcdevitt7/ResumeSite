                        Welcome and thank you for visiting my website!
                        My Name is Katie McDevitt and I'm currently working as a software developer and I really love being in the tech industry. 
                        It's always changing and there's so much to learn, which I find really exciting. 
                        In my latest project, I got to do a lot of designing and creating API endpoints to handle and move data around.
                        I've been lucky enough to be involved in every step of software development, from the initial planning and designing right through to programming and quality assurance.
                        I've also been working with Amazon Web Services, using tools like S3, DynamoDB tables, Redshift, and API Lambdas. 
                        I even had the chance to help design some DynamoDB and Redshift tables. 
                        I genuinely enjoy the tech field because it offers so much room to grow and learn. 
                        I like pushing myself, especially in a field that can be as complex as tech.

                        I have a passion for problem-solving and thrive on being presented with challenging issues. 
                        This is why I am drawn to computer science and software development. 
                        Additionally, I am enthusiastic about data analytics and data science, as both require strong critical thinking skills. 
                        These fields align with my love for continuous learning, as I have always been a naturally curious individual. 
                        The ever-evolving nature of the tech industry ensures that there are always new things to learn, fueling my endless curiosity.

                    In my journey through the tech world, I've developed a keen interest in both data science and software engineering.
                    On my Work Experience Page, you'll see that I've delved deep into data from both the development and analytical sides, giving me a well-rounded perspective on how to handle it effectively.
                    This mix of experiences has really sparked my curiosity in both areas.
                    I'm on the lookout for a company that'll let me keep growing, take on challenging projects, and come up with creative solutions.
                    I thrive in environments that value learning and offer chances to sharpen my skills.
                    Ultimately, I aspire to make a meaningful impact at a company by leveraging my skills and contributing to its success and growth.
