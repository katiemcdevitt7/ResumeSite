                    <p class="description"> 
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my current position, I played a key role in an automation project where I designed and programmed multiple API endpoints tailored to handle large data transformation and transfers effectively. 
                        I gained valuable hands-on experience working within an Agile development lifecycle and utilized CI/CD practices to streamline our software development process, ensuring the delivery of high-quality, scalable solutions efficiently. 
                        Although I officially received the title for this position in January 2024, I began taking on the responsibilities of this role in July 2023 while also fulfilling my duties as a Data Analyst (as detailed below).
                        Managing both roles simultaneously during this overlapping period challenged me to hone my organizational and time management skills, allowing me to excel in executing tasks and meeting deadlines effectively.

                            <li>Designed and implemented numerous API endpoints using Python with FastAPI Framework and AWS Cloud service to facilitate reliable data exchange and scalability</li>
                            <li>Planned and engineered edge cases to thoroughly test code to ensure coverage of various scenarios</li>

                        Starting in February 2022, I began in this role on a contract basis, diving into the world of creating detailed reports about specific product usage. 
                        It wasn't long before I was offered a full-time position as a Data Analyst.
                        In this role, I collaborated closely with the sales team on various customer accounts, deciphering utilization metrics and crafting visual reports. 
                        Additionally, I handled ad-hoc cases to address specific data inquiries. Within just two months, I was placed on the top account, tasked with analyzing and forecasting utilization to support both the sales and accounting departments. 
                        Eager to streamline processes, I leveraged my programming skills to develop scripts that automated report generation, significantly reducing turnaround times. 
                        Even after moving from the position, these scripts continue to be utilized, improving efficiency and inspiring the creation of additional scripts to further enhance the speed of addressing ad-hoc cases.

                    <p class="description"> 
                        As the general manager, I was the backbone of our front-end business operations. 
                        I not only had the privilege of selecting and training our incredible team but also had a hand in scheduling and organizing customer events. 
                        Ensuring the smooth flow of these events was a priority, and I was always ready to tackle any challenges or issues that popped up along the way. 
                        Beyond people management, I also took charge of our inventory and orders, ensuring everything was in its right place and on time. 
                        One of the exciting parts of my role was learning and mastering the Embedd system. 
                        This knowledge came in handy, especially when it came to troubleshooting any technical glitches that arose, making sure everything ran seamlessly.
